# Amazon Physical Packaging

## About

It's not uncommon for someone to order something from Amazon.com these days and the packaging they use seems to be fairly standardized so I figured it wouldn't be a bad idea to compile a few bits and pieces of information about the physical packaging that Amazon uses into an open source data set.

Yes, there are several other places on the internet where one can obtain this data but there's no way for anyone to directly contribute and/or collaborate on the data (i.e. to my knowledge, this is the first iteration of this data that exists on the internet which is open source).

## Usage

This data should be kept simple and easy to use which is why the data set is in [JSON format][JSON Data Interchange Format Specification] and the dimensions, of type `float`, have been specified in _both_ inches and centimeters.
