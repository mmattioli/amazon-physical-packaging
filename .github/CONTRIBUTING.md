## Styling

Please adhere to the following styling guidelines when filling out the issue
template:

 * __Designation__ of type `string` should simply be the code/designation found
 somewhere (usually on the exterior) of the packaging. For example: the
 package designated with code `1A5` had a smaller code beside it, `B45`;
 please ignore the smaller code.

 * __Dimensions__ of type `float` should include _both_ inches and centimeters
 in order to make this data more usable/portable. [Google] [Google] or
 [WolframAlpha][WolframAlpha] will be able to help you with the conversion(s),
 if necessary; if they produce results with more than three (3) decimal
 places, please round to the third (3rd) decimal place (e.g. `123.4567` should
 be `123.457`) and if they produce results that are whole numbers, please
 append a `.0` (e.g. `10` should be `10.0`). If a certain type of packaging
 only has two (2) dimensions, such as envelopes, please omit the `length`.

 * __Description__ of type `string` should be short and simple; be sure to
 capitalize the first letter of each word and ignore the coloring of the
 packaging (i.e. `Cardboard Box` or `Padded Envelope`).
